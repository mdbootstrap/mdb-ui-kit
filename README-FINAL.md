<h1 align=center>Bootstrap Material Design</h1>

Bootstrap Material Design is the best way to use [Material Design guidelines by Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
in your Bootstrap 4 based application.
Since this is a fully customizable version of Bootstrap, just include Bootstrap Material Design CSS instead of Bootstrap CSS, and include the JavaScript at
the end of your document (just before the `</body>` tag), and everything will be converted to Material Design.
