// Sizing and positioning below here

// for left or right drawers, setup widths, heights and positions
@include bmd-drawer-x-out($bmd-drawer-x-size);

// for top or bottom drawers, setup widths, heights and positions
@include bmd-drawer-y-out($bmd-drawer-y-size);

// Marker class for both triggering the opening of the drawer (i.e. javascript #addClass('.bmd-drawer-in')), as well
//  as responsive sizes (i.e. bmd-drawer-in-md will open once the browser is wider than 768px).
//
//
// bmd-drawer-in, bmd-drawer-in-sm, bmd-drawer-in-md, bmd-drawer-in-lg
//  We iterate over the standard grid breakpoints, but we also need styles for the simpler `bmd-drawer-in`
//  without a size (for triggered openings).  Since the xs size is 0, instead of using `bmd-drawer-in-xs`
//  (which is mostly meaningless), we create `bmd-drawer-in` meaning always open.
//
//  NOTE: bmd-drawer-in-* uses media-breakpoint-up()
//
// bmd-drawer-out
//  A marker class that will _force_ the drawer closed regardless of the responsive class present. If (for some
//  strange reason) both bmd-drawer-out and bmd-drawer-in are present, it appears that the closed option wins.
//
// bmd-drawer-overlay, bmd-drawer-overlay-sm, bmd-drawer-overlay-md, bmd-drawer-overlay-lg
//  We iterate over the standard grid breakpoints, but we also need styles for the simpler `bmd-drawer-overlay`.
//  Since the xs size is 0, instead of using `bmd-drawer-overlay-xs`, we create `bmd-drawer-overlay` meaning always overlay.
//
//  NOTE: bmd-drawer-overlay-* uses media-breakpoint-down() - this is because we usually want a responsive overlay to be used in small screen scenarios.
//

//
// Drawer open positioning, and style options (push is default, overlay is optional)
:not(.bmd-drawer-out) {
  // first eliminate positioning or sizing rules if the drawer is already forced closed
  @each $breakpoint in map-keys($grid-breakpoints) {
    @include bmd-drawer-x-in-up($bmd-drawer-x-size, $breakpoint);
    @include bmd-drawer-y-in-up($bmd-drawer-y-size, $breakpoint);

    @include bmd-drawer-x-overlay-down($breakpoint);
    @include bmd-drawer-y-overlay-down($breakpoint);
  }
}

////----
//// Example 1: creates a media responsive kitchen-sink-drawer that pairs with bmd-drawer-in-lg and allows for the bmd-drawer-in trigger
//.kitchen-sink-drawer {
//  $custom-size: 500px;
//  @include bmd-drawer-x-out($custom-size);
//  &:not(.bmd-drawer-out) {
//    @each $breakpoint in map-keys($grid-breakpoints) {
//      @include bmd-drawer-x-in-up($custom-size, $breakpoint);
//    }
//  }
//}
//
////
////----
//// Example 2: creates a NON-responsive kitchen-sink-drawer and allows for the bmd-drawer-in trigger
//.kitchen-sink-drawer-static {
//  $custom-size: 500px;
//  @include bmd-drawer-x-out($custom-size); // closed by default
//  @include bmd-drawer-x-in($custom-size); // triggered with bmd-drawer-in
//  @include bmd-drawer-x-overlay(); // overlay by default, no other classes necessary
//}
